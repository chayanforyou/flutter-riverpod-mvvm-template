## Flutter Riverpod MVVM Template

This application allows users to explore popular Flutter repositories on GitHub, sorted by star count (most popular first). It provides a seamless experience for browsing repositories with the following features:

- Repository List: Displays a list of repositories with essential information including the repository name, number of stars, and owner.
- Infinite Scroll: As you scroll down, additional repositories are automatically loaded in batches of 10, ensuring a smooth browsing experience.
- Repository Detail Page: Clicking on a repository card takes you to a detailed page displaying information about the repository owner, a detailed description, and the last update time.
- Performance Optimization (Optional): The app caches the repository list to enhance performance and reduce the number of API calls.

This application is a great tool for discovering trending Flutter repositories, making it easier to keep up with the Flutter ecosystem.
